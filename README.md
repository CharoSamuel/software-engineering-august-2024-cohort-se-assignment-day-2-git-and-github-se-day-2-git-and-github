## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control has been deemed to have significant key concepts including Tracking changes, commits, branches, merging and collaboration. The changing concept gives a room for every change to a file to be recorded in a repository.  The commit concept represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. The branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes independently and can later be merged back into the main codebase upon completion of the changes. Merging on the other hand gives room for the updated code being merged back into the main branch, integrating the new feature or fix into the project after completion of changes in a branch. Lastly the collaboration concept gives room of a multiple contributors working on the same project concurrently without overwriting each other's work. 
GitHub Is a Popular Tool for Version Control, widely used for managing code versions because of several key features including hosting repositories, pulling requests, issuing tracking and project management and integration with continuous integration and continuous development. 
repositories in the cloud, allowing multiple developers to access, contribute, and collaborate on the same codebase from anywhere.
Version Control is also deemed significant in the technology of software development as it maintains project integrity through providing a complete history of changes, making it easy to track who made specific modifications and why.
